# SHAPEAI CYBER SECURITY BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr.Harsh Akshit. I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>PYTHON
<li>INTRODUCTION TO Selenium for web automation
<li>FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN SQL INJECTION
<li>SOLVING CAPTURE THE FLAG ON HACKER101
<li>FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT AND PENETRATION TESTING[VAPT]
 
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
